## Installing R and RStudio

To use the package one needs to install R and RStudio. R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and is available for various operating systems. I recommend not to use the latest release as it takes some time before all packages are updated and therefore might results in errors. I normally use the second to last release.

Rstudio can be downloaded [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). The free version is sufficient. 


## Installing gdxrrw

To interface between R and GAMS the GDXRRW package is required. This package is not available in CRAN, the R package repository and therefore cannot be installed using the standard approach (i.e. `install.packages("gdxrwww")`). Hence, one has to install it manually. The package can be found [here](https://support.gams.com/gdxrrw:interfacing_gams_and_r)

To install GDXRWW:

1. Copy the latest version (GDXRRW.zip) to a temporary folder on your machine
2. Click 'Packages' > 'install' in RStudio
3. Select 'Install from: Package Archive File (.zip; .tar; .gz)
4. Select GDXRRW.zip to install the package in your R library

Note that the version of GDXRWW has to match your R version, otherwise there might be an error. Thus, if you have R version 3.5.X install the GDXRWW version that is built with R 3.5.x.

## Installing GLOBIOMtools


## Installing other R packages



## Installing additional software

Although not strictly necessary to use GLOBIOMtools (for now), I recommend installing the following additional software:

- osgeo4w. This is a collection of open source geospatial software for windows and can be downloaded [here](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w). Most important part is gdal, which is a very powerful translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats. It is used by several R packages that process raster and vector data. osgeo4w is only available for windows. gdal for other systems can be downloaded [here](https://gdal.org/download.html).

- miktex. This is (one of) implementations of TeX/LaTeX and related programs. RStudio facilitates the use of LaTex through Rmarkdown but this requires the installation of [miktex](https://miktex.org). If you want to learn more about this look [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

- git. [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
